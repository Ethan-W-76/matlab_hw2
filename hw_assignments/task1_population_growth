% This code is a Population Growth Analysis Model for a given dataset. 
%   It will display the population and growth rate in a table. 

% Population Vector with the given data 
population = [5000 5200 5350 5600 5800]; 

% Year over Year Growth Rate Vector represented as a percentage 
growth_rate = (population(2:end) - population(1:end-1)) ./ population(1:end-1) * 100; 

% Initial Growth Rate (zero, due to first data set) 
growth_rate = [0 growth_rate]; 

% Matrix between population and growth_rate
pop_data = [population; growth_rate];

% Displaying a Table to represent the data 
fprintf('Year\tPopulation\tGrowth Rate (%%)\n');

for i = 1:length(population)

    if isnan(growth_rate(i))
        fprintf('%d\t%d\t\tN/A\n', i, population(i));

    else
        fprintf('%d\t%d\t\t%.2f%%\n', i, population(i), growth_rate(i));

    end
end
